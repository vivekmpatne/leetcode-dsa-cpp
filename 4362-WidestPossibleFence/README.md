# 4007. Widest Possible Fence

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-possible-fence/)

---

You are given an integer array `planks`, where `planks[i]` represents the height of the `i^th` wooden plank. Each plank has a width of 1 unit.

You want to build a fence consisting of planks that all have the **same** height.

You may either use a plank as is, or combine **exactly** two distinct original planks into a single plank whose height **equals** the sum of their heights. Each original plank can be used **at most** once, and not all original planks need to be used.

Return the **maximum possible width** of the fence that can be built.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** planks = [1,3,2,5,7,5,4,2,1]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

We can have four planks of height 5.

- `planks[3] = 5`
- `planks[5] = 5`
- `planks[0] + planks[6] = 1 + 4 = 5`
- `planks[1] + planks[2] = 3 + 2 = 5`

Hence, the maximum width is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** planks = [2,3,7]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

- It is impossible to form two planks of the same height, even after combining two distinct original planks.
- Since not all original planks need to be used, we can choose any one plank as the fence.
- Therefore, the maximum possible width is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= planks.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= planks[i] <= 10^9`
